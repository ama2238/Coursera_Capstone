    "   After much anticipation from Canadians, Trader Joe’s, an American-based chain of grocery stores, has finally decided to expand its operations into Canada. They would like to start by opening one store in Canada, and are divided between opening a store in one of Canada’s top two populated cities – Toronto and Montreal. \n",
    "   In order to enable them to decide on what city to open a store in, Trader Joe’s senior management has decided to analyze the characteristics of both cities and determine which city will be a great fit for their new store. Using the Foursquare location data, we will be assisting them to gather deep insights about both cities. \n",
