    "1) After much anticipation from Canadians, Trader Joe’s, an American-based chain of grocery stores, has finally decided to expand its operations into Canada. They would like to start by opening one store in Canada, and are divided between opening a store in one of Canada’s top two populated cities – Toronto and Montreal. \n",
    "In order to enable them to decide on what city to open a store in, Trader Joe’s senior management has decided to analyze the characteristics of both cities and determine which city will be a great fit for their new store. Using the Foursquare location data, we will be assisting them to gather deep insights about both cities. \n"

    "2) The data that we will be using to gather information on both cities will mainly be Foursquare location data on Toronto and Montreal. More specifically, we will focus on the following data elements: buying habits, average income, population demographics (age group and gender), tax system, size of the city’s trading area, population and population trends, total purchasing power and who has it, number and size of competition, quality and aggressiveness of competition. Using Foursquare location data, we will gather information on the buying trends in other grocery stores in both cities, so that we have a better idea of the purchasing power of each city. \n",
    "In conjunction with Foursquare location data, we will also be using Google Trends data to enable us to make a more informed decision about what city Trader Joe’s should choose.\n"
